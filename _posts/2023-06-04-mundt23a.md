title: 'Continual Causality: A Retrospective of the Inaugural AAAI-23 Bridge Program'
abstract: 'Both of the fields of continual learning and causality investigate complementary
  aspects of human cognition and are fundamental components of artificial intelligence
  if it is to reason and generalize in complex environments. Despite the burgeoning
  interest in investigating the intersection of the two fields, it is currently unclear
  how causal models may describe continuous streams of data and vice versa, how continual
  learning may exploit learned causal structure.   We proposed to bridge this gap
  through the inaugural AAAI-23 “Continual Causality” bridge program, where our aim
  was to take the initial steps towards a unified treatment of these fields by providing
  a space for learning, discussions, and to build a diverse community to connect researchers.
  The activities ranged from traditional tutorials and software labs, invited vision
  talks, and contributed talks based on submitted position papers, as well as a panel
  and breakout discussions. Whereas materials are publicly disseminated as a foundation
  for the community: https://www.continualcausality.org, respectively discussed ideas,
  challenges, and prospects beyond the inaugural bridge are summarized in this retrospective
  paper.'
