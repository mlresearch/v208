title: Causal Concept Identification in Open World Environments
abstract: The ability to continually discover novel concepts is a core task in open
  world learning. For classical learning tasks new samples might be identified via
  manual labeling. Since this is a labor intensive task, this paper proposes to utilize
  causal information for doing so. Image data provides us with the ability to directly
  observe the physical, real-world appearance of concepts. However, the information
  presented in images is usually of noisy and unstructured nature. In this position
  paper we propose to leverage causal information to both structure and causally connect
  visual representations. Specifically, we discuss the possibilities of using causal
  models as a knowledge source for identifying novel concepts in the visual domain.
