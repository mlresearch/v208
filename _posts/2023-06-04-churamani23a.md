title: Towards Causal Replay for Knowledge Rehearsal in Continual Learning
abstract: Given the challenges associated with the real-world deployment of Machine
  Learning (ML) models, especially towards efficiently integrating novel information
  on-the-go, both Continual Learning (CL) and Causality have been proposed and investigated
  individually as potent solutions. Despite their complimentary nature, the bridge
  between them is still largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on causality to
  improve the learning and knowledge preservation capabilities of CL models. In particular,
  positing Causal Replay for knowledge rehearsal, we discuss how CL-based models can
  benefit from causal interventions towards improving their ability to replay past
  knowledge in order to mitigate forgetting.
