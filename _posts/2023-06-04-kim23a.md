title: Modeling Uplift from Observational Time-Series in Continual Scenarios
abstract: As the importance of causality in machine learning grows, we expect the
  model to learn the correct causal mechanism for robustness even under distribution
  shifts. Since most of the prior benchmarks focused on vision and language tasks,
  domain or temporal shifts in causal inference tasks have not been well explored.
  To this end, we introduce Backend-TS dataset for modeling uplift in continual learning
  scenarios. We build the dataset with CRUD data and propose continual learning tasks
  under temporal and domain shifts.
