title: 'Continual Treatment Effect Estimation: Challenges and Opportunities'
abstract: 'A further understanding of cause and effect within observational data is
  critical across many domains, such as economics, health care, public policy, web
  mining, online advertising, and marketing campaigns. Although significant advances
  have been made to overcome the challenges in causal effect estimation with observational
  data, such as missing counterfactual outcomes and selection bias between treatment
  and control groups, the existing methods mainly focus on source-specific and stationary
  observational data. Such learning strategies assume that all observational data
  are already available during the training phase and from only one source. This practical
  concern of accessibility is ubiquitous in various academic and industrial applications.
  Thatâ€™s what it boiled down to: in the era of big data, we face new challenges in
  causal inference with observational data, i.e., the extensibility for incrementally
  available observational data, the adaptability for extra domain adaptation problem
  except for the imbalance between treatment and control groups, and the accessibility
  for an enormous amount of data. In this position paper, we formally define the problem
  of continual treatment effect estimation, describe its research challenges, and
  then present possible solutions to this problem. Moreover, we will discuss future
  research directions on this topic.'
