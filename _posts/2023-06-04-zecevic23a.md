title: Continual Causal Abstractions
abstract: This short paper discusses continually updated causal abstractions as a
  potential direction of future research. The key idea is to revise the existing level
  of causal abstraction to a different level of detail that is both consistent with
  the history of observed data and more effective in solving a given task.
