title: Spurious Features in Continual Learning
abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is the research field addressing training settings
  where the data distribution is not static. One of the core problems CL addresses
  is learning without forgetting. To solve problems, continual learning algorithms
  need to learn robust and stable representations based only on a subset of the data.
  Those representations are necessarily biased and should be revisited when new data
  becomes available. This paper studies spurious features’ influence on continual
  learning algorithms. We show that in continual learning, algorithms have to deal
  with local spurious features that correlate well with labels within a task only
  but which are not good representations for the concept to learn. One of the big
  challenges of continual learning algorithms is to discover causal relationships
  between features and labels under distribution shifts.
