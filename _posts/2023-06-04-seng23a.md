title: Treatment Effect Estimation to Guide Model Optimization in Continual Learning
abstract: Continual Learning systems are faced with a potentially large numbers of
  tasks to be learned while the models employed have only limited capacity available,
  which makes it potentially impossible to learn all required tasks within a single
  model. In order to detect on when a model might break we propose to use treatment
  effect estimation techniques to estimate the effect of training a model on a new
  task w.r.t. some suitable performance measure.
