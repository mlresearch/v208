title: Prospects of Continual Causality for Industrial Applications
abstract: We have been investigating the causal analysis of industrial plant process
  data and its various applications, such as material quantity optimization utilizing
  intervention effects. However, process data often comes with various problems such
  as non-stationary characteristics including distribution shifts, which make such
  applications difficult. When combined with the idea of continual learning, causal
  models may be able to solve these problems. We present the potential and prospects
  for industrial applications of continual causality, showing previous work. We also
  briefly introduce our causal discovery method utilizing a continual framework.
