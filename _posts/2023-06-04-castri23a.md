title: From Continual Learning to Causal Discovery in Robotics
abstract: Reconstructing accurate causal models of dynamic systems from time-series
  of sensor data is a key problem in many real-world scenarios. In this paper, we
  present an overview based on our experience about practical challenges that the
  causal analysis encounters when applied to autonomous robots and how Continual LearningÂ (CL)
  could help to overcome them. We propose a possible way to leverage the CL paradigm
  to make causal discovery feasible for robotics applications where the computational
  resources are limited, while at the same time exploiting the robot as an active
  agent that helps to increase the quality of the reconstructed causal models.
