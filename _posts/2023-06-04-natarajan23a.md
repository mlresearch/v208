title: 'Never Ending Reasoning and Learning: Opportunities and Challenges'
abstract: 'Inspired by the motivation behind the Never-Ending Language Learner (NELL),
  a continual learning system that reads the web, we propose the never-ending reasoning
  and learning paradigm and one instance: the  Never-Ending Reasoner and Learner (NERL),
  which continuously learns and reasons with causal models by actively interacting
  with domain experts.  NERL necessitates tight synergistic interaction between different
  communitiesâ€”continual learning, causal modeling, statistical relational AI, and
  human-allied AI communities. We motivate NERL using the real, high-impact problem
  of global mitigation of adverse pregnancy outcomes, present the challenges in this
  system, and  highlight the potential opportunities that provide for interdisciplinary
  collaborations.'
